#summary Getting started

= Introduction =

The DoW2 Toolbox is a collection of tools made for modding Dawn of War 2 including its addons Chaos Rising and Retribution.

The most important information:
 * written in C# using Visual Studio
 * uses standard C# notation (methods starting with capital letters, CamelCase)
 * currently consists of 6 separate project files:
  # _CopeModToolDoW2_ contains mainly user interface elements
  # _CopeShared_ contains mainly manager classes
  # _ImageViewerPlugin_ is a plugin for the Toolbox which allows images to be viewed
  # _RBFEditorPlugin_ is a plugin as well and includes an RBF editor
  # _ScarPlugin_ is a plugin and offers very basic support
  # _ModDebug_ is a DLL that enables advanced debugging capabilities by injecting itself into the Game
 * all the code for actually reading/writing game file formats isn't part of this project but of _cope.DawnOfWar2.dll_ from the cope-framework (see further below)

-----

Uses parts of the cope-framework; available here: http://www.s-schoener.com/files/cope_framework.zip
Parts of this framework are planned to go open source soon as well (with _cope.DawnOfWar2_ being merged with the Toolbox).
